/*
From the keyboard take in a number. Determine if the number is odd or even. 
If the number is even assign the string literal "Even" to a string variable if it is odd assignment the string literal "Odd" to the string.  This should be computed using the conditional operator. 
The conditional operator is NOT an if else. It is a substitute for it.

Once you have computed the value output it to the screen. 
Do not use println in conjunction with the conditional. 
Do NOT duplicate variable assignment within the conditional. 
Assign the value to the variable once.
