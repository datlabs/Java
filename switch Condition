/*
Take in a number from the keyboard the corresponds to a particular month. 
Using a switch statement to determine the name of the month and output it to the console. 
For instance if the input was 8 the output would be August. You should also have a default statement that will report when there is invalid input. 
In other words any value that is not between 1 and 12
